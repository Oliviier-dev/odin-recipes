    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Lasagna is a popular Italian dish consisting of layers of flat pasta sheets, delicious tomato-based sauce, creamy cheese, and flavorful fillings.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>Onion, garlic, and olive oil</li>
        <li>Crushed tomatoes or tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Italian herbs and spices like oregano</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to the specified temperature according to your recipe.</li>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onions and minced garlic, and sauté until they become soft and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add ground meat (beef, pork, or a combination) to the skillet and cook until it is browned and cooked through. Break up the meat into small pieces as it cooks.</li>
        <li>Once the meat is cooked, add crushed tomatoes or tomato sauce to the skillet, along with Italian herbs, such as oregano, basil, and thyme. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Simmer the sauce for about 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the layers to set and makes it easier to slice and serve.</li>
    </ol>
